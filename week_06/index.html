        Once upon a time two cats found a piece of cheese and cut it into two pieces. Now, one piece was slightly bigger than the other. Naturally, both the cats wanted the bigger piece.

So they decided to approach a monkey and ask him to sort out the matter.

The monkey said, 'Don't worry. I'll make both the pieces equal. Then it took a bite from the bigger piece. But this made the other piece larger. So it took a bite from the other piece. This continued till the pieces became very small.


 
Seeing this, the cats pleaded, 'Sir. We are satisfied. Let us have the pieces now.'

The shrewd monkey replied, 'This is my fee for sorting out the problem.'

Saying this, it gobbled up all the remaining cheese.
